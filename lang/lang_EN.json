    "swing_2": "<h4>The motivation of the software:</h4><br>One of the end products of steel production is rolled sheet, which is also sold in the form of sheet metal, wide coils and strips for further processing to the processing industry. The application facilitates the optimization of strip cutting, for cold and hot rolled steel coil(s) with the aim of maximising finished good and reducing waste.<br><br>Based on the following inputs/parameters the program will produce the optimal cutting pattern:<br>- The calculator creates the optimal cutting pattern for the manufacture of one or more coil(s).<br>- The pattern is capabale of munufacturing five different strip widths simultaneously.<br>- The pattern is capabale of munufacturing four different coil inner diameters.<br>- Strip weight determination per unit weight based on different dimensions selected for picking.<br>- Determination of the mass of strips in total and  mass per strip size.<br>- Determination of the proportion of dimensions.<br>- Determination of strip diameter based on different sheet dimensions.<br>- Determination of the body thickness of the strip related to the size and number of sheets required.<br>- Calculates losses taking into account  surface and material defect rates.<br>- Determination of the amount of waste generated.<br>- The software issues warning messages to create the correct slitting dimensions.",

There was one common point among others between the companies, that the finished products had to be delivered to the next processor company. Most of the time with truck. Based on my preious experience, I created the following web application in which I also focused on the possibility of using this software on a mobile phone or on a tablet as well.<br><br>Used technologies for the application: <strong>Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Maven, H2 database, Linux server, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap.</strong><br><br>You can find accesses of this web application via the links below the image.<br><br>",

For the sake of simplicity unlimited amount of different types of products and empties are available in the warehouse.<br><br>You can make the cargo plan regarding cargo space, different weigths and detailed list in the end.<br><br><h4>How the program is working?</h4><br>There are three tables to help you to do the cargo plan or check it what you done: Specifications, Packaging Instruction, Empties list.<br><br><h6><strong>Specifications Menu</strong></h6>It contains regulations for the packaging and loading of bulk goods.<br><br><h6><strong>Packaging Instruction Menu</strong></h6>This list includes packaging requirements for various machine parts regarding its type of empties and its quantities.
